Today, we’re excited to announce that KintoHub’s team will be joining [Cash App](https://cash.app/), an app that allows individuals to spend, send, store, and invest money!

<!--truncate-->

It’s been a long journey where KintoHub has evolved from a microservice marketplace to the full-stack app platform that it is today. After many years and effort, we’ve been searching for how to make modern cloud development easier and the best way to provide that value to the community. We have decided it’s best to give KintoHub [a new home on GitHub](https://github.com/kintoproj) and allow the toolset to be developed as open-source software under the Apache 2.0 license.

The Kinto team is excited to work on empowering and improving developer velocity within Cash App. This opportunity has extended the team's passion to a new dimension and we're excited about the work ahead.

As for the KintoHub community, it’s been a beautiful journey working with everyone, and we’re excited to see what you all do with the open-source version of KintoHub. KintoHub’s SaaS version will go offline on **March 12th, 2021**. Until then, you may contact the team on [discord](https://kintohub.com/discord) or [support@kintohub.com](mailto:support@kintohub.com) to receive help on how to migrate off of KintoHub and onto KintoHub’s open-source version, which can work on any cloud provider with a Kubernetes cluster. The team is in talks with the [CD Foundation](https://cd.foundation/) and several other companies looking to unite in continuing the development of KintoHub through open source. We hope this pathway will enable the community to continue to grow and provide a better solution for the unique needs of every big or small app being developed in the cloud!
