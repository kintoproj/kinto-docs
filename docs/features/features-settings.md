## CI/CD

Check out [CI/CD](features-ci-cd.md) for more information.

## Public API

Public APIs are available only for [Backend Services](/service-types/types-backend-api.md).
This toggle allows you to enable or disable a secure public hostname for your service to be accessed.
**Backend Services** by default are public.

When disabled, you may only access your service from another service within the same [Environment](features-environment.md) on KintoHub using its [internal hostname](features-access.md#how-it-works).
For example:

- Service A is a **Backend Service** which is only used for internal operations.
- Service B is a **Job** service can access it using its [internal hostname](features-access.md#how-it-works).
- Service C is a **Web App** and runs on customers' browsers **cannot** access Service A since it does not have an [external hostname](features-access.md#how-it-works).

## Suspend a service

The Suspend service option will allow you to temporarily stop your services running on KintoHub. At any point, the stopped services can be fully resumed and redeployed.

### In order to suspend services:

1. Go to the Settings tab and then click on the **Suspend Service** button.

Once you confirm, the services will stop running and status will change to `Suspended`.

To resume your services, click on the **Resume** button.

This is an irreversible action and your service will be shutdown immediately.

1. Follow the instructions above on getting to the **Settings** tab and then click on the `Delete Service` button.
2. Type in the service name in the prompt and again click on the `Delete` button.
