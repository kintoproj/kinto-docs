title: Environment Variables

Environment Variables are used as both **Run Time** and **Build Time** lifecycle of your app.
During the **Build** stage of your **Deploy** action, your app's code gets pulled and compiled and may access environment variables similar to how you would use a local `.env` file or operating system specific variables for compiling your app.
In addition to building time, when your app starts, the same Environment Variables are available for usage.

Environment Variables allow you to make configuration easier for your app. By specifying specific _API KEYS_ or `dev` versus `prod` configurations such as `LOG_LEVEL` can be driven by Environment Variables.

:::note
Environment Variables are not available for Catalog services.
