Metrics provides near real-time information about vCPU and Memory that your service uses.
This information is valuable as you will be able to optimize your cost by viewing your actual usage compared to what you are paying for.
In addition to cost savings, you may also detect issues with your service by seeing how many times it has restarted.
A **Restart** is when your service has crashed and KintoHub has automatically brought it back online.
