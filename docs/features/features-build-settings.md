## Web App and Backend API Build Settings

Aside from **General Build Settings** Web Apps and Backend APIs introduce the following:

- **Port** - The port in which your app will service your API.

## Background Workers Build Settings

Background workers have no special build settings aside from the ones described in **General Build settings**.

## Jobs Build Settings

Aside from **General Build Settings** Jobs introduces the following:

- **Run Timeout** - if your job takes longer than this specified time, it will fail with a timeout.
- **Schedule Cron Job** - When enabled, your job will run on a schedule.
  If you do not enable a schedule, you will need to manually trigger your job via a CI/CD event or **Trigger Deploy** button at the top right of your service.

:::tip
Set the **Run Timeout** to the lowest value that you know should never happen.
If your job runs longer than the time you specify, KintoHub will cancel the job as a Timeout.
This protects your job from running up your bill when an infinite loop / never-ending code problem occurs.
