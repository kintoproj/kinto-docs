## When to use a static site?

Static websites are a good choice when you want to couple them with content delivery networks (CDN) or have a website that does not require a port.

If your website requires a port, checkout for Web Apps [here](/service-types/types-web-app.md#static-site)

:::note
Static site service is provided with **Build Output Path** field. The HTML files required by the site are fetched from the output path specified.
