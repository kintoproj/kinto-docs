title: Backend API
---

KintoHub can host and scale any backend API for public requests or internal service to service requests.
Each backend API gets a public https endpoint and internal endpoint for communication.
Usually, backend APIs perform business logic such as registering or authenticating users or calculating the top 100 users on a leaderboard.

## When to use a backend API service?

If your app is serving the following protocols, you should consider using a Backend API Service:

- HTTP
- TCP
- Websocket endpoint

:::note
The following protocols have not been tested.

- HTTP/2
- gRPC
- TCP
- UDP
